For the purposes of this project, a county is classified as Democratic if the Democratic presidental candidate had the highest percentage of votes in 2016, and Republican if the Republican presidental candidate had the highest percentage of votes in 2016. The dataset we are using, which shows the Democratic/Republican voting breakdown for every county in the U.S. and the charactersitics of each of these counties can be found [here](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/usa-2016-presidential-election-by-county/export/?disjunctive.state).\n"

If our model were to be making mostly Republican predictions and have thus a high accuracy rate, we would want to know if this is because the model can properly distinguish what a Republican county looks like or the model is simply giving Republican labels most of the time without making that distinction. Creating a confusion matrix would be a more effective way to analyze the performance of a model instead of simplying looking at it's accuracy rate.\n",

And the bottom right is the nuumber of True Negative Classifications (number of records classified Democratic that were actually Democratic).\n",

Precision is the probability that given a Repbulican classification, how likely is it to be correct. And Recall is the probability that given a Republican record, will it be classified as such. In this scenario, we are particularly interested in a high recall rate. The F-measure is also calculated which is a combination of both the precision and recall metric.\n"
